# 9. Broadcast & Social Media Content

## 9.1. Driver Information

1. Team Information will be pulled from the ISOWC.org website for the broadcast. Drivers will be able to edit this but edits made on race-day are not guaranteed to be reflected on broadcast.
2. Once the entry list is confirmed, drivers will be requested to provide a driver headshot, as well as their team logos. As with paint files, drivers have until Tuesday 23:59 UTC during the race week to make updates. Files submitted after this deadline will be included in the following round’s broadcast.

## 9.2. Social Media

1. ISOWC will post a variety of content to social media. Drivers are free and encouraged to utilize social media posts as they wish
2. Photos will be provided by Improvised Design for the series. Full-resolution downloads will be made available to all teams for your own media production
3. The official Paint Packs will be provided to all teams on the Friday before each race.

## 9.3. Broadcast Schedule

1. All 6 races will be broadcast live on RaceSpot TV. The series will also be featured on the VRS Twitch channel.
2. The podium finishers will be interviewed on the post-race show. Drivers must ensure they have TeamSpeak installed – the RaceSpot TeamSpeak address is ts.racespot.tv
3. Drivers may be asked to be interviewed in between races to be featured on the pre-show – these interviews will be cut and edited for the broadcast but the clips may be used on social media as well!

## 9.4. Webcams

1. Drivers are invited to share their camera view using RaceSpot’s Zoom. For more information on joining and setting up your camera, visit the [RaceSpot User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_j6uBApVcmcaSwnVTDkiP06gqPRFzKU6gV9jet6chzw/edit)
2. By sharing your webcam, driver’s agree to share their camera views throughout the broadcast. No audio will be captured through Zoom and we recommend you mute the audio and your microphone to minimize distractions
