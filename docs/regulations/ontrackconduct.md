# 6. On Track Behaviour

## 6.1. General

1. It is expected that all drivers within the series race in a fair, honest manner, paying consideration to other drivers on the race track, and not committing any actions that may bring the league into Disrepute.
2. Drivers are expected to treat other members within the series, in a courteous manner at all times. Drivers using insulting, threatening, racist, sexist, homophobic, or any other form of derogatory behaviour, either in written or spoken format, in the league race server or otherwise will face severe penalties, up to and including expulsion from the league.
3. It is the responsibility of both the car overtaking, and the car being overtaken, to ensure a clean pass takes place. Once the overtaking car's front wing passes the rear of the car in front, it is deemed to be entitled to that line, and therefore the car being overtaken should allow the overtaking car to hold his line into the corner.
4. A Driver must not alter his/her racing line based on the actions of pursuing Drivers or use an abnormal racing line to inhibit or prevent passing. Blocking will result in a penalty being given by Race Control
5. Drivers entering Pit Lane should alert other drivers of their intentions, and position their car in such a way that they can leave the racing surface to enter pit lane. It is not the responsibility of other drivers to provide space for a driver to navigate off the racing surface, however a driver may not change lanes with the intention of obstructing/impeding the safe movement of another driver onto the slowdown lane.
6. Drivers exiting pit lane should use the pit exit lane to ensure sufficient speed is built up before re-joining the main racing surface. Drivers should be mindful of other drivers, especially of the closing rate of cars from behind, and position their car in such a way that does not cause the potential of hazards to other drivers.
7. There is no obligation for drivers to move aside for the leader(s), when being placed a lap(s) down, so long as the driver maintains the minimum speed/lap time requirements, and does not drive in a manner that may cause an incident.
8. Drivers being placed a lap(s) down should maintain a steady racing speed, ensuring that the car overtaking has fully completed the pass, and no other driver will be compromised before switching lanes.
9. Drivers may not force other drivers off the racing line, through contact, nor may they verbally intimidate them through the use of the iRacing chat feature. Drivers found doing so will be issued a penalty from Race Control.

## 6.2. Communication With Other Drivers/Race Control

1. Drivers should be able to communicate safely with other drivers and Race Control at all times when on track, either through Microphone, or through typing.
2. Drivers should keep Race Chat clear under green, for reporting of accidents/incidents, communicating with other drivers about overtaking, and communicating with race control only. Drivers engaging in too much race chat will have their chat functions disabled.
3. Drivers should use Race Chat under caution to alert other drivers as to the whereabouts of the Pace Car, sorting out restart orders, and communicating with race control. Whilst general chatter is acceptable under caution, it must not disrupt the use of Race chat to provide information to other drivers, nor interfere with Race Control procedures.
4. Drivers should respond to Race Control when requested concerning incidents, wave off warnings, connection issues, and any other reasonable request when asked. Failure to do so may result in them being waved off the track.
5. Drivers should treat other drivers, and Race Control with respect at all times when using Race Chat functions. Any driver failing to observe this may have their chat disabled, or be liable to incur a penalty.
6. In the event of an incident between drivers, Race Chat should not be used to argue, or create animosity. In the event that a driver feels that another driver is responsible for an incident, it should be reported to Race Control.
7. Drivers may not argue with the decisions of Race Control during, or after a race. Any decision made by Race Control is final.
8. Drivers should not shout, use CAPS, or otherwise distract other drivers whilst racing. Any driver failing to observe this may have their chat disabled.

## 6.3. Oval Races

1. Drivers should remain on the main racing surface at all times, driving below the white line only when entering/leaving pit lane, or to avoid a wreck.
2. Passing below the white line is forbidden at all times. A Driver gaining an advantage by deliberately running below the white line will incur a penalty from race control.
3. Drivers should not "Pinch" other drivers below the white line, or force them any higher than necessary. Drivers found to be excessively pinching other drivers will be issued with a warning from Race Control.
4. Drivers should maintain a constant, and steady speed around the track, and not force drivers into checking up or altering their line unnecessarily.
5. On entering a corner, a driver should choose a lane which they should then run around the entire duration of the corner, changing lanes only to avoid an incident, or prevent an incident from occurring.
6. In the event that a driver "Brushes Up" the race track (Where the car moves from the inside lane up the track towards the wall), a driver may only return to the inside lane if no other driver's line/momentum will be compromised by he/she doing so, or to avoid an incident/slower car.

## 6.4. Road Races

1. For the avoidance of doubt, the Racing surface is defined as the layout of the track, including kerbs. The racing surface does not however, include the areas to the side of the track immediately before and after a kerb.
2. In the event of a track having multiple layouts, the racing surface will be defined as the area highlighted by cones, tyre barriers, or other means. Use of areas of track outside these areas is defined as leaving the racing surface.
3. Any incident that receives a 1x Off Track incident will be deemed as leaving the racing surface, as well as this, placing more than half the car off of the main race track will be classed as leaving the racing surface, unless it is part of a normal exit line.
4. Drivers should remain on the main racing surface at all times, driving away from the racing surface only when entering/leaving pit lane, or to avoid a wreck.
5. Drivers leaving the race surface, through accident, or avoiding an incident may not improve their position at any time. Drivers leaving the racing surface must also concede a position if leaving the racing line avoids another driver overtaking them.
6. Drivers may not leave the racing line in order to gain a time advantage over other cars in any circumstances. This will be seen as cutting the track, and will incur a	penalty from Race Control.
7. In the event of a driver missing their breaking point into a chicane, and using the escape road, the driver must come to a full stop before resuming and re-joining the race track.
8. Drivers should choose a line when entering a corner, and then run the same line for entire duration of it, allowing room for a driver who is alongside, to also race effectively.
9. In the event that a corner directly leads to another, with no opportunities to change lanes, drivers should hold the same lane throughout the complete sequence of corners.
10. In the event that drivers racing "Side By Side" down a straight approach a corner, each driver should use the lane they are in as the lane they will run through the corner.
11. In the event of a corner having only one lane, or not being sufficiently wide enough to promote safe "Two Wide" racing, then it is the responsibility of both drivers to ensure that they can each safely make the corner. In this case, the driver who holds the natural racing line has the right to the corner, so long as he provides sufficient room to the other driver to also make the turn.
12.	Drivers may alter their position on the race track, in relation to the car behind once on any straight. This move may only be to change lanes, or to hold the natural racing line, and may not be used for deliberate blocking.
13.	In the event of a driver pulling alongside another driver on a straight, it is deemed that he has that line into that corner, and therefore, the driver being overtaken should hold the other lane. A car is deemed as being alongside as soon as the front wing of the overtaking car passes the rear of the car in front, regardless of if the spotter announces their position or not. Furthermore, the driver overtaking must hold the lane through the corner, unless he has fully cleared the car, and is able to switch lanes before the corner, without compromising the speed of the other car, once he/she has fully cleared it.
14.	Drivers may not drive in such a way through corners that compromises the ability of other cars to race, or with the intention of preventing a slower car from getting "A run" coming out of it. Drivers must maintain a steady and consistent line and speed through all parts of the track.
