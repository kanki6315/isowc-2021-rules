# 7. Points and Championships

## 7.1. Race Scoring

1. Points will be awarded to any driver starting the race, so long as they have not been prohibited to do so by race control. Points will be awarded on the following scale:
|                        |                 |                 |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1st: 50 Points         | 2nd: 40 Points  | 3rd: 35 Points  |
| 4th: 32 Points         | 5th: 30 Points  | 6th: 28 Points  |
| 7th: 26 Points         | 8th: 24 Points  | 9th: 22 Points  |
| 10th: 20 Points        | 11th: 19 Points | 12th: 18 Points |
| 13th: 17 Points        | 14th: 16 Points | 15th: 15 Points |
| 16th: 14 Points        | 17th: 13 Points | 18th: 12 Points |
| 19th: 11 Points        | 20th: 10 Points | 21st: 9 Points  |
| 22nd: 8 Points         | 23rd: 7 Points  | 24th: 6 Points  |
| 25th Onwards: 5 Points |                 |                 |
2. In the event that more than 25 drivers start the race, all drivers finishing in positions 25th and rearward will receive 5 points
3. 2 points will be awarded to the driver who records the fastest lap in qualifying. This will normally be the driver who starts from Pole Position barring any penalties.
  1. A Driver having made an incident (Including a 0x contact) on their fastest qualifying lap will not have it counted by the iRacing software, and therefore said lap will not be eligible for Pole position, or fastest qualifying lap.
  2. Any lap where a driver leaves the racing surface, as defined in section 5 will not have that lap counted in relation to fastest qualifying lap scoring. In the event that 2 or more drivers share the fastest qualifying lap time, then 1 point will be awarded to each driver.
4. 2 points will be awarded to the driver who records the fastest lap in the race, as determined by the iRacing results page. A Driver having made an incident (Including a 0x contact) on their fastest lap will not have it counted by the iRacing software, and therefore said lap will not be eligible for the fastest lap 
  1. Laps driven after a penalty has been awarded, before the completion of said penalty will not have that lap counted in relation to fastest lap scoring.
  2. Any lap where a driver leaves the racing surface, as defined in section 5 will not have that lap counted in relation to fastest lap scoring.
  3. In the event that 2 or more drivers share the fastest lap time, then 1 point will be awarded to each driver.
4. 2 points will be awarded to the driver who leads the most laps in the race, as determined by the iRacing results page.
5. Any driver disqualified from the race will have all their points revoked, including bonus points earned through qualifying and obtaining the fastest lap. In this case, these bonus points will not be redistributed.

## 7.2 Championships

1. At the conclusion of the season, the driver with the most points will be crowned the 2021 ISOWC champion.   
2. There will be no drop weeks in this championship. With only 6 races in the 2021 ISOWC season, we have avoided conflicts with similar series as well as avoiding conflicts with real life motorsports as much as possible with the goal of having all drivers free for every race.
3. In the event of two or more drivers achieving the same score in any ISOWC championship, the driver with the highest number of wins will be awarded the higher finishing position. In the event of this failing to determine a difference, the number of second places backwards will be taken into account. If drivers are still tied, then the driver with the lowest number of incidents will be awarded the higher finishing position.

## 7.3. Prizes

1. In total, the 2021 ISOWC season will pay out $7,000 USD to its members. This will be split into three prize pools – the overall championship pool, the per-race pool, and the ISOWC 500 pool.
2. There may be additional physical prizes that are awarded – these will be announced separately and will not affect the main prize pools.
3. All cash prizes will be paid in one payment at the end of the season once the results have been confirmed by Race Control. Payments will be made via PayPal to the same email that submitted the entry fee unless local government restrictions apply – arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis in this situation.
4. Driver’s will be responsible for paying any fees associated with currency conversion
