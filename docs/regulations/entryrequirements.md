# 2. Entry Requirements

1. Users wishing to join the series must hold either a road or oval C Class license, at the time of joining. This must be kept throughout the entirety of the series in order to continue competing.
2. In the event of a user's license falling below a C Class, it is the responsibility of the user to bring his license back up to the required level, before continuing to race in the series. Any driver racing below this license level will be withdrawn from the race, and score zero points for that event.
3. Drivers cannot participate in the series whilst suspended from iRacing Official Series activity. It is presumed that such drivers have accorded themselves in a manner that is outside of the spirit of the ISOWC Series, and therefore is not welcome during their suspension. Any driver found to be participating within the series whilst suspended from iRacing Official Series activity will be subject to additional sanction, including possible permanent expulsion from the league. 
4. Drivers must be a member of the official ISOWC Discord Server. All league communications will be through the Server.
