# 5. Race Control

## 5.1. Introduction

1. Each race will have at least 2 series admins monitoring on track activity. The purpose of this admin is to act as a form of Race Control, to ensure clean, fair racing. In particular, Race Control will be ensuring that both on and off track conditions are upheld throughout the year. Most drivers have nothing to worry about. They are already in full compliance of the rules, and the rulebook is designed to promote safe, competitive racing, not catch drivers out. For those who feel the need to repeatedly make life a misery for their competition through their action, or who cannot act within the spirit of the rules, the series will cease to welcome them.

** Remember. It is not a right to run in the ISOWC Series.**

2. Race Control have the ability to award penalties to drivers who they feel fail to drive in a clean, fair manner, act recklessly, or otherwise affect the spirit of competition within the league. The penalty given, if not set out already within these rules, will be determined by Race Control, in a consistent manner.
3. Race Control have the right to wave drivers off the track, if they feel that their speed/lap times are too slow, or if they pose a risk to other drivers due to their driving, or connection issues. In this case, a driver will first be warned, and given time to correct this. In the event that the issue persists, a final warning will be issued, before the driver is retired from the race.
4. Race Control is not able to reverse penalties generated through iRacing, give drivers voluntary EOL penalties or give Wave Around to any driver.

## 5.2. Incident Procedure

1. In the event of Race Control wishing to review an incident, they will create an incident report on the ISOWC official website which will promptly a notification both in-sim as well as in the official ISOWC Discord server. Drivers may be requested to support their corner if necessary, in helping Race Control to form a balanced opinion.
2. A driver may request an incident to be looked at by alerting Race Control either through the text chat function, or through audio. A driver will also be able to grant permission for a “spotter” to create incident reports on the ISOWC official website. An incident request should involve
  -	The lap number
  - The car(s) involved
  -	The nature of the incident
3. Drivers may report incidents up to 12 hours after the end of the race. Any penalties being applied post-race will be in the form of a time penalty equivalent to time that would have been lost for the appropriate penalty in the race.
4. Race Control will aim to make a decision to each incident within 10 minutes of it being reported, however, if there are many incidents, it may take longer for a decision to be made. Drivers will be alerted of any delays to investigating an incident.
5. On race control having reviewed an incident, and making a decision on the outcome, the official decision will be entered on the ISOWC official website. This will trigger a message being sent both to the in-sim chat as well as to the ISOWC Discord Server. If the field is under caution, Race Control may choose to delay the issuing of a penalty until after the resumption of Green Flag racing, and the relevant driver will be made aware of this.
6. In some instances, Race Control may deem that the incident does not warrant a penalty alone, especially if it is the drivers first incident of that kind. In this case the driver will be issued with a warning, advising them of what further action would be taken should the incident be repeated.
7. In the event of an incident taking place in the last 10 laps of an oval race, or 5 laps of a road course race, Race Control will review the incident at the conclusion
of the race. In this instance, if a penalty is awarded, the duration of the penalty will be added to the overall time of the driver being awarded the penalty.
8. There is no right to appeal any decision made by Race Control during, or after a	race. Any abuse towards race control will be seen as a further violation, and another penalty will be issued either during the race, before the publication of official results, or for the next race the driver enters, as is deemed appropriate.
9. Race Control will, upon request give fuller reasoning as to why a penalty was awarded after the race has been completed, either verbally, or in writing. This should however, be regarded as a statement, and no further discussion will be entered into the incident.

## 5.3. Wave Off Procedure

1. Race Control will monitor the lap times, and in race conduct of all drivers, in order to ensure safe, clean racing within the series.
2. Minimum speeds/times will be advertised on both the event announcement thread, and the event description on the event "Hosted" race screen prior to the commencement of the race. It is a driver’s responsibility to ensure that he/she meets this minimum speed/time before joining.
3. Race Control may ask drivers to set a number practise time on race fuel, to ensure that they meet the minimum speed requirements. Drivers unable to achieve this may not be allowed to qualify/race, or may be asked to start from the rear of the field.
4. Drivers consistently setting lap times below the minimum speed may be warned by Race Control. The driver will then have 5 racing laps in which to meet the minimum speed, and will be placed under review by Race Control.
5. It is acceptable for drivers to fall below the minimum speed/ lap time as they are placed lap(s) down by the leader, so long as the driver returns to setting times within the minimum speed allowance once they have been lapped.
6. It is acceptable, towards the end of a race/race stint, for a driver's lap times/speed to fall below the minimum requirements, in the event that a driver is conserving tyres/fuel, so long as their speed does not become dangerous, or adversely affect the ability of other drivers to race.
7. In the event that a driver continuously falls below the minimum speed/lap time, after being placed on review by race control, they will be asked to return to Pit Lane and retire from the race. Failure to do so after 3 racing laps will result in the driver being disqualified from the race.
8. A driver having been "Waved Off" the race track, so long as they return to Pit Lane within the designated 3 laps, will be classified as having retired from the event, and will be placed in the final results as having retired on the lap they returned to Pit Lane.
