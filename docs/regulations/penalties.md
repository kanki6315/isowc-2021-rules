# 10. Penalty Structure & Penalty Points

## 10.1. Penalty Table
1. When reviewing incidents, Race Control will use various penalty codes to categorize the verdict reached by race control. Each penalty code has an associated in-race & post-race penalty, as well as penalty points used to help guide decision making. Race Control has full discretion to adjust the penalty length & penalty points awarded if they deem it necessary.

| P01          | The stewards have determined that whilst there is fault of a driver, there has been a minimal/zero performance disadvantage.

The driver will have three laps to give these positions back, else will recieve a P04/P05 penalty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Return Position(s).

| P03          | The stewards have determined that a driver has gained an unfair advantae over competitors due to a technical violation, which can include: a pitlane violations, off-tracks being exceeded or an incorrect start/restart.

This may be either 5, 10 or 15 seconds based on severity of incident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Time penalty, to be added at the end of the race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Time penalty, to be added at the end of the race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1 - 2          |
| P04          | The stewards have determined that a driver has committed an offence which warrants a drive through penalty. This could either due to a false start/restart, contact with another driver or an unsafe re-join that causes an incident.   The driver must drive through pit lane at pit speed and re-join the race. Failure to do so within three laps of being issued will result in an automatic disqualification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Drive through penalty (issued as an iRacing Black Flag).  Should this penalty be issued in the last 3 laps of the race and the driver choose not to take it, iRacing will automatically calculate the time that a driver will lose.                                                                                                                                        | Time penalty, equivalent to the length of time taken to drive through the pit lane at pit speed.  To be added at the end of the race.                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 -2           |
| P05          | The stewards have determined that a driver has committed an INTENTIONAL offence which warrants a stop and hold penalty. This could either due to a deliberate false start/restart that imapcts on other driver's ability to start the race, contact with another driver or an unsafe re-join that causes an incident.   A driver will recieve a black flag, and be required to drive down the pit lane at pit lane speed. The driver will then need to remain in their pit stall for the penalty time before exiting the pit lane at pit lane speed. Failure to do so within three laps of being issued will result in an automatic disqualification.  Should a driver have two or more P05 infractions detemined simuultaneously, they will be issued sepparately, and therefore, the driver will need to complete the full penalty pprocess for each issuue. The second/subsequent black flags will be shown once the driver has completed the first/prior penalty. | Stop and hold penalty (15/30 seconds - issued as an iRacing Black Flag)  Should this penalty be issued in the last 3 laps of the race and the driver choose not to take it, iRacing will automatically calculate the time that a driver will lose. Should more than two violations be issued in the last three laps, a further time penalty will be issued after the race. | Time penalty, equivalent to the length of time taken to drive through the pit lane at pit speed, plus the time taken to serve the penalty.  5 additional seconds will be added to the time taken to drive through pit lane, to account for a driver slowing into and accelerating out of their pit box. | 2 - 5          |
| P06          | The stewards have determined that a driver has committed an INTENTIONAL offence, which is so severe that disqualification from the event is the only course of action. The driver will be immediately required to withdraw from the race, and will be automatically facilitated by the iRacing software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Disqualification  Issued via iRacing software.

## 10.2. Penalty Points
1. Over the course of a season, drivers can accumulate penalty points for each penalty they receive. The accumulation of penalty points may result in additional penalties being applied to the driver, which are described in the table below.
| Penalty Point Total | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
