# Introduction
The ISOWC Seriesâ€™ aim is to foster close, competitive and friendly racing for drivers around the world. This rulebook ensures that all drivers uphold the ethos and principles of the ISOWC series at all times when engaging in series competition.

This website will contain the regulations. A PDF version of these regulations will be made available on the official discord server. It is the responsibility of all drivers and Team Managers to read through these regulations and ensure full understanding of their contents. The Regulations apply to all sessions that are hosted by Race Control - including Free Practice sessions that might be hosted during race week.


## Discord Server
All communication from the league organizers will be distributed via our [official discord server](https://discord.gg/jNASfBZAeB). All questions must be sent to our discord server or via a direct PM to a Race-Control official through discord.

We aim to keep all documents accessible via our website, however we restrict access to most forms such as the protest form - these are only accessible in a restricted section of our league. Any additional documents that cannot be hosted on the website will be posted in our Discord!
