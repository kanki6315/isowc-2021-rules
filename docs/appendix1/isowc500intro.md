# 1. ISOWC 500 SUPPLEMENTARY RULEBOOK

## 1.1. Introduction

1. These supplementary rules are in use only for the final round of the season. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any rule contradicts something mentioned in the Series Rulebook, the rule posted here will overrule/invalidate it. Furthermore Section 5.3 of the series rulebook will not be in force for these qualifying sessions.
2. These supplementary rules are designed to mimic as much as possible real life situations. There are some features/changes that have had to be made due to the limitations of iRacing, however these have been overcome as much as possible.
3. Drivers wishing to partake in the race must first follow the instructions on the relevant promotional documents. Entry is not guaranteed without this, and any conditions relating to this are met.
4. When drivers register for the race, they will be asked to select which qualification session they wish to enter, morning or afternoon (Based on UTC times). Drivers may only select one session, and are reminded that the times from the two sessions will be combined to create the final standings for the first round of Qualifying.
5. This is the feature event of the ISOWC, and therefore, the quality of racing is designed to reflect this. Race Control and Series Administrators reserve the right to exclude, or refuse entry to any driver who, in their opinion would detrimentally affect the quality of racing, or who would portray a negative image of the series. This however is not a decision which will be taken lightly, and would only be used in the event of a drivers showing constant previous unsportsmanlike behaviour in ISOWC races, or who continually portray this behaviour in the Qualifying Sessions.
6. This race will be broadcast on RaceSpot TV, and a recording available to be viewed on Demand. By registering for the race, you agree to your name, team, car, and any other relevant features being used in this broadcast, as well as on RaceSpot TV and iRacing Publications.
7. Due to the extra time required to arrange the starting grid for the race, 203 laps will be advertised on the server. The extra 3 laps are to help facilitate arranging the cars for the start of the race, and will not affect the overall race distance.

## 1.2. Radio Communication Protocol (Qualifying)

1. In order to preserve authenticity radio communication will be limited to race control members only. All communications shall be limited to text chat or private text chat through Discord. Race control will limit its voice transmissions to periods of time between qualification attempts. This rule will be strictly enforced to in order to maintain minimum voice transmissions and ensure uninterrupted qualification attempts.
2. Drivers who do not respect this rule will be given 1 warning, a second infraction will result in chat privileges being removed for the duration of the session
3. If a driver is attempting a qualifying run he or she is allowed to transmit on iRacing radio, in order to communicate if they are waving off their run, or if Race Control is waving them off the track.
4. Drivers will be invited to use the ISOWC Discord Channel in lieu of iRacing’s Voice Chat service usage being restricted. Drivers are reminded that the same rules for voice communication apply to Discord as on iRacing, and any foul/abusive language. Drivers who do not respect this rule will be given 1 warning; a second infraction will result in chat privileges being removed for the duration of the session, or, in extreme circumstances, being removed from the TeamSpeak server.

Whilst general chatter is acceptable under caution, it must not disrupt the use of Race chat to provide information to other drivers, nor interfere with Race Control procedures.
4. Drivers should respond to Race Control when requested concerning incidents, wave off warnings, connection issues, and any other reasonable request when asked. Failure to do so may result in them being waved off the track.

2.	Qualifying Sessions will utilize static skies, a set track state and fixed weather settings chosen by Race Control and communicated to all teams 2 weeks before the ISOWC 500 Qualifying. All sessions will be setup in the same configuration to minimize variance across sessions.
3.	Practice & Race Sessions will utilize dynamic weather This will be done by using a pre-set date & time when generating the iRacing session, and using the “Dynamic Weather” functionality that iRacing provides.
